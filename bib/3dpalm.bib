abstract = {The evidential value of palmprints in forensics is clear as about 30% of the latents recovered from crime scenes are from palms. While palmprint-based personal authentication systems have been developed, they mostly deal with low resolution (about 100 ppi) palmprints and only perform full-to-full matching. We propose a latent-to-full palmprint matching system that is needed in forensics. Our system deals with palmprints captured at 500 ppi and uses minutiae as features. Latent palmprint matching is a challenging problem because latents lifted at crime scenes are of poor quality, cover small area of palms and have complex background. Other difficulties include the presence of many creases and a large number of minutiae in palmprints. A robust algorithm to estimate ridge direction and frequency in palmprints is developed. This facilitates minutiae extraction even in poor quality palmprints. A fixed-length minutia descriptor, MinutiaCode, is utilized to capture distinctive information around each minutia and an alignment-based matching algorithm is used to match palmprints. Two sets of partial palmprints (150 live-scan partial palmprints and 100 latents) are matched to a background database of 10,200 full palmprints to test the proposed system. Rank-1 recognition rates of 78.7% and 69%, respectively, were achieved for live-scan palmprints and latents.},

abstract = {Palmprint has proved to be one of the most unique and stable biometric characteristics. Almost all the current palmprint recognition techniques capture the 2-D image of the palm surface and use it for feature extraction and matching. Although 2-D palmprint recognition can achieve high accuracy, the 2-D palmprint images can be counterfeited easily and much 3-D depth information is lost in the imaging process. This paper explores a 3-D palmprint recognition approach by exploiting the 3-D structural information of the palm surface. The structured light imaging is used to acquire the 3-D palmprint data, from which several types of unique features, including mean curvature image, Gaussian curvature image, and surface type, are extracted. A fast feature matching and score-level fusion strategy are proposed for palmprint matching and classification. With the established 3-D palmprint database, a series of verification and identification experiments is conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that 3-D palmprint technique has high recognition performance. Although its recognition rate is a little lower than 2-D palmprint recognition, 3-D palmprint recognition has higher anticounterfeiting capability and is more robust to illumination variations and serious scrabbling in the palm surface. Meanwhile, by fusing the 2-D and 3-D palmprint information, much higher recognition rate can be achieved.},

abstract = {Previous works have shown that the ear is a promising candidate for biometric identification. However, in prior work, the preprocessing of ear images has had manual steps and algorithms have not necessarily handled problems caused by hair and earrings. We present a complete system for ear biometrics, including automated segmentation of the ear in a profile view image and 3D shape matching for recognition. We evaluated this system with the largest experimental study to date in ear biometrics, achieving a rank-one recognition rate of 97.8 percent for an identification scenario and an equal error rate of 1.2 percent for a verification scenario on a database of 415 subjects and 1,386 total probes.},

abstract = {In today's world, biometrics system is used almost everywhere for the security and personal recognition. The palmprint is one of the most reliable physiological characteristics that can be used to distinguish between individuals. Palmprint classification provides an important indexing mechanism in a palmprint database. An accurate and consistent classification can greatly reduce palmprint matching time for a large database. We propose a palmprint classification algorithm which is able to classify palmprints into ten evenly-distributed categories (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, A, B, C, D, and E). The algorithm uses a novel representation and is based on a two-stage classifier to make a classification.},

abstract = {A generalized discriminant analysis based on a new optimization criterion is presented. The criterion extends the optimization criteria of the classical Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) when the scatter matrices are singular. An efficient algorithm for the new optimization problem is presented. The solutions to the proposed criterion form a family of algorithms for generalized LDA, which can be characterized in a closed form. We study two specific algorithms, namely Uncorrelated LDA (ULDA) and Orthogonal LDA (OLDA). ULDA was previously proposed for feature extraction and dimension reduction, whereas OLDA is a novel algorithm proposed in this paper. The features in the reduced space of ULDA are uncorrelated, while the discriminant vectors of OLDA are orthogonal to each other. We have conducted a comparative study on a variety of real-world data sets to evaluate ULDA and OLDA in terms of classification accuracy.},

In contrast to existing palmprint systems for criminal applications, the proposed system targets at the civil applications, which require identifying a person in a large database with high accuracy in real-time. The system is constituted by four major components: User Interface Module, Acquisition Module, Recognition Module and External Module. More than 7,000 palmprint images have been collected to test the performance of the system. The system can identify 400 palms with a low false acceptance rate, 0.02%, and a high genuine acceptance rate, 98.83%. For verification, the system can operate at a false acceptance rate, 0.017% and a false rejection rate, 0.86%. The execution time for the whole process including image collection, preprocessing, feature extraction and matching is less than 1 second.},

abstract = {A new approach for the personal identification using hand images is presented. This paper attempts to improve the performance of palmprint-based verification system by integrating hand geometry features. Unlike other bimodal biometric systems, the users does not have to undergo the inconvenience of passing through two sensors since the palmprint and hand geometry features can be are acquired from the same image, using a digital camera, at the same time. Each of these gray level images are aligned and then used to extract palmprint and hand geometry features. These features are then examined for their individual and combined performance. The image acquisition setup used in this work was inherently simple and it does not employ any special illumination nor does it use any pegs to cause any inconvenience to the users. Our experimental results on the image dataset from 100 users confirm the utility of hand geometry features with those from palmprints and achieve promising results with a simple image acquisition setup.},

abstract = {The recently proposed technique of temporal phase unwrapping has been used to analyze the phase maps from a projected-hinge phase-shifting surface profilometer. A sequence of maps is acquired while the fringe pitch is changed; the phase at each pixel is then unwrapped over time independently of the other pixels in the image to provide an absolute measure of surface height. The main advantage is that objects containing height discontinuities are profiled as easily as smooth ones. This contrasts with the conventional spatial phase-unwrapping approach for which the phase jump across a height discontinuity is indeterminate to an integral multiple of 2 pi. The error in height is shown to decrease inversely with the number of phase maps used. (C) 1997 Optical Society of America.},
